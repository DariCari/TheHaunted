# TheHaunted
A Minecraft plugin that adds the old GommeHD.net game called "The Haunted"

How to use:
- To add a page spawning location type "/addpage", while staring at an item frame.
- To add a player spawn location type "/addspawn", while looking at the block the player should spawn on.
- Set the sword spawning location with "/setspawn".

NOTE:
- You have to add at least as much pages as set in the config
- It is recommended to use the resourcepack for a better experience
