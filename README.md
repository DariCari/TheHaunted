# TheHaunted
A Minecraft plugin that adds the old GommeHD.net game called "The Haunted". It is very similar to the game called "Slender the Eight Pages", in which the player has to collect enough pages before he/she gets tracked down and killed.

How to use:

    To add a page spawning location type "/addpage", while staring at an item frame.
    To add a player spawn location type "/addspawn", while looking at the block the player should spawn on.
    Set the sword spawning location with "/setspawn".

NOTE:

    You have to add at least as many pages as set in the config
    It is recommended to use the resource pack for a better experience
